# Calculator

Usually, any application will have to do some sort of calculations.

For eg,
- calculating no of users in the system
- calculating no of files created by an user in the system
- calculating no of sportsman participating in olympics
and so on

Goal of this project to demonstrate the pitfalls of large numbers in a calculation

### Problem
Calculations on relatively small numbers are not a concern for most scenarios
The problem arises when a number is greater than or equal to `2^53`
